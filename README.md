<h1>FritzBoxApi</h1>
<span>This simple 'API' will log in to your local FritzBox with the given password and URL (the default URL is https://fritz.box) and can return all devices that are in the local network.</span>

<h1>Usage</h1>
<span>This simple approach shows how to initialize the FritzBoxAccesser and get the devices from the FritzBox.</span>
<br/><br/>

```csharp
using FritzBoxApi;
public class Program
{
    private static async Task Main(string[] args)
    {
        FritzBoxAccesser.SetAttributes("password");
        FritzBoxAccesser access = new FritzBoxAccesser();
        var devices = await fritzBoxAccesser.GetAllDevciesInNetworkAsync();

        foreach(Device device in devices)
            Console.WriteLine($"Device: {device.Name}, is active: {device.StateInfo.Active}");
    }
}
```

<span>Specify more details for the accessor:</span>
```csharp
FritzBoxAccesser.SetAttributes(fritzBoxPassword:"password", fritzBoxUrl: "https://192.168.178.1", userName: "fritz1234");
FritzBoxAccesser fritzBoxAccesser = new FritzBoxAccesser();
```
